## üìã Reference Materials (Keep Handy)

### Ansible Command Quick Reference
```bash
# Basic commands
ansible --version              # Check Ansible version
ansible all -m ping            # Test connectivity to all hosts
ansible all -m setup           # Gather facts from all hosts
ansible-playbook playbook.yml  # Run a playbook

# Inventory management
ansible-inventory --list       # Show inventory structure
ansible-inventory --graph      # Show inventory as graph

# Ad-hoc commands
ansible webservers -m copy -a "src=/local/file dest=/remote/file"
ansible dbservers -m service -a "name=mysql state=started"
ansible all -m shell -a "uptime"
```

### Common YAML Patterns in Ansible
```yaml
# Basic playbook structure
---
- name: Example playbook
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  vars:
    app_name: myapp
    app_port: 8080
  
  tasks:
    - name: Install packages
      apt:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop:
        - nginx
        - python3
        - git
    
    - name: Start service
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```

### Ansible Facts and Variables
```yaml
# Using facts
- name: Display system info
  debug:
    msg: "{{ ansible_distribution }} {{ ansible_distribution_version }}"

# Custom variables
- name: Set custom variable
  set_fact:
    app_path: "/opt/{{ app_name }}"

# Variable precedence
# 1. extra vars (command line)
# 2. task vars
# 3. block vars
# 4. role and include vars
# 5. play vars
# 6. host facts
# 7. host vars
# 8. group vars
# 9. inventory vars
# 10. role defaults
```
