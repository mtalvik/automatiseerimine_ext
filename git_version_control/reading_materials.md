## üìã Reference Materials (Keep Handy)

### Git Command Quick Reference
```bash
# Basic workflow
git status                    # Check repository status
git add <file>               # Stage changes
git commit -m "message"      # Commit staged changes
git push origin <branch>     # Push to remote

# Branching
git branch <name>            # Create new branch
git checkout <branch>        # Switch to branch
git merge <branch>           # Merge branch into current
git rebase <branch>          # Rebase current on branch

# History and inspection
git log --oneline           # Compact commit history
git diff                    # Show unstaged changes
git diff --staged           # Show staged changes
git show <commit>           # Show commit details
```

### Common Git Scenarios
```bash
# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (discard changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Stash changes temporarily
git stash
git stash pop

# View remote repositories
git remote -v
```
